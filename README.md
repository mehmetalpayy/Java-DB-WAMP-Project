# Java-DB-WAMP-Project

Java-DB-WAMP-Project is a Java application that interacts with a WampServer database. It allows you to upload an SQL file to WampServer and retrieve data from the database using Java. You can perform various operations on the data, such as filtering and modifying records.

## Project Structure

The project repository consists of the following files and directories:

- `assets/JavaDBAPP/others`: Contains important project details and screenshots of the application after execution. It also includes a `games.sql` file that contains sample data about games.

- `build/classes`: Contains the compiled files generated by the Eclipse IDE when you build the project.

- `nbproject`: Contains configuration files generated by the Eclipse IDE during project development. These files are essential for the project to compile and run correctly.

- `src/DatabaseProject`: Contains the Java source files for the project:

    - `Controller.java`: Implements the controller logic for the GUI, handling user actions and events.

    - `DatabaseProject.java`: Contains the main class of the application. It initializes the GUI and connects to the WampServer database using `Dbconnector.java`.

    - `Dbconnector.java`: Establishes the connection between the Java application and the WampServer database.

    - `GamesNew.java`: Represents a model class for games, defining its properties and methods.

    - `View.form` and `View.java`: Define the graphical user interface (GUI) components and their functionality. The `View.form` file is generated by the GUI builder in Eclipse.
